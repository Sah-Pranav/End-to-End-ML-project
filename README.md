# üè° End-to-End-ML Project (King County House Price Prediction)

A regression project to predict the sale price of houses using the **King County House Sales dataset** from Kaggle.

---

## üìñ Introduction About the Data :

The goal is to predict the `price` of a given house using various physical, locational, and structural parameters.

**The dataset contains 21 independent variables (including `id`)**:

| Variable | Description |
|:--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | Unique identifier for each house sale |
| `date`          | Date of the house sale |
| `price`         | Sale price of the house (target variable) |
| `bedrooms`      | Number of bedrooms |
| `bathrooms`     | Number of bathrooms (where .5 accounts for a half bath) |
| `sqft_living`   | Interior living space in square feet |
| `sqft_lot`      | Total lot size in square feet |
| `floors`        | Number of floors |
| `waterfront`    | 1 if waterfront view; 0 otherwise |
| `view`          | Index from 0 to 4 indicating view quality |
| `condition`     | Condition of the house (numerical scale) |
| `grade`         | Overall grade based on construction and design |
| `sqft_above`    | Square footage excluding basement |
| `sqft_basement` | Square footage of the basement |
| `yr_built`      | Year the house was built |
| `yr_renovated`  | Year the house was renovated (0 if never) |
| `zipcode`       | Location zip code |
| `lat`           | Latitude coordinate |
| `long`          | Longitude coordinate |
| `sqft_living15` | Average living area of 15 nearest neighbors |
| `sqft_lot15`    | Average lot size of 15 nearest neighbors |

**Target variable**:

- `price` : Sale price of the house

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Load CSV dataset.
   - Split into training and test datasets.
   - Save locally as separate files.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Numeric columns: Median imputation ‚ûù StandardScaler.
   - Categorical columns (if any): Most frequent imputation ‚ûù Encoding ‚ûù StandardScaler.
   - Save the transformation pipeline as a `.pkl` file.

3. **Model Training**
   - Test multiple regression algorithms (like Linear Regression, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor,CatBooAdaBoostRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor, and CatBoostRegressor.)
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.
   - Save the best model as `model.pkl`.

4. **Prediction Pipeline**
   - Create a pipeline that loads the model and preprocessor.
   - Transforms incoming data and returns predictions.

5. **Flask Web Application**
   - Build a user interface using Flask for online predictions.
   - Integrate prediction pipeline.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploy using AWS Elastic Beanstalk (or Streamlit/Render/Heroku).
