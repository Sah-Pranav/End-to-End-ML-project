## 📖 About the Data

The dataset includes 21 features related to physical, locational, and structural house attributes.  
**Target variable:** `price` (house sale price)
 

**Dataset Source:**  
👉 [Kaggle - King County House Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)

## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Load CSV dataset.
   - Split into training and test datasets.
   - Save locally as separate files.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Numeric columns: Median imputation ➝ StandardScaler.
   - Categorical columns (if any): Most frequent imputation ➝ Encoding ➝ StandardScaler.
   - Save the transformation pipeline as a `.pkl` file.

3. **Model Training**
   - Test multiple regression algorithms:
     - Linear Regression  
     - KNeighborsRegressor  
     - DecisionTreeRegressor  
     - RandomForestRegressor  
     - AdaBoostRegressor  
     - GradientBoostingRegressor  
     - CatBoostRegressor  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.
   - Save the best-performing model as `model.pkl`.

4. **Prediction Pipeline**
   - Create a pipeline that loads the trained model and preprocessor.
   - Transforms incoming data and returns predictions.

5. **Flask Web Application**
   - Build a simple, interactive user interface using Flask for live predictions.
   - Integrate the prediction pipeline for real-time results.
